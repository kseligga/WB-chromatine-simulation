# Simulation of chromatin structure using simulated annealing methods
In this project, we used graph and simulated annealing algorithms to recreate chromatin structure from the source files.

Full documentation can be found in file 'Raport WB.docx'

We managed to achieve a correlation of approximately 0.6-0.7 between our structure and the HI-C contacts file:
